- Hello all, my name is James Winters, I’m a Cybersecurity Enthusiast looking to have my opportunity to take part in the Cyber field.
- I'm currently in a Cybersecurity Boot Camp via JMU (James Madison University), and so far I've learned so much! Under CompTia I learned A+, Network+, Security+, Python, CEH (Certified Ethical Hacking), and CySA+
- If possible, I’m looking to collaborate on projects that are more tailored to development and security of those programs.
- You can connect with me here - LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-d-winters/
